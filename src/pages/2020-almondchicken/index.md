![Almond Flour Crusted Chicken](./almondchicken.jpg)


### Recipe 

* 2 or 3 chicken breasts
* 1 cup almond flour (use only Â¾ cup if using 2 chicken breasts)
* 2 tsp seasoning of choice (I use one that has sea salt, rosemary, garlic, sage, and black pepper)
* 1 egg, beaten
* 2 T unrefined coconut oil



### Instructions

1.	Pound chicken breasts flat with a mallet or rolling pin until chicken is about 1/4 -- 1/8 inch thick (it helps to use wax paper to cover the chicken while pounding)
2.  Prepare dredging station:
3.  Beat egg in one shallow dish
4.  Mix almond flour with seasoning in another shallow dish (depending on the number/size of chicken breasts you may need to add more almond flour and/or beat another egg)
5.	Heat coconut oil in large skillet over medium heat until melted
6.	Dip each chicken breast in egg wash, then coat with seasoned almond flour and add to pan (be careful of hot coconut oil splattering)
7.	 Cook on medium/high heat for 10 minutes a side
8.	 Remove chicken and pat excess oil with paper towels

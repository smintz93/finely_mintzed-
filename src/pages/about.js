      Hello everyone! My name is Johanna Mintz and I am so excited to welcome
      you to my blog, FinelyMintzed. I am originally from Chicago, but currently
      living in Washington, DC, after graduating from Georgetown University in
      2018. While I enjoyed cooking throughout college, my love for cooking and
      crafting new recipes in the kitchen has sky-rocketed in my post-grad life.
      My favorite way to unwind after work is to head straight to the kitchen
      and start prepping dinner (or a post-dinner treat). My love for all thing
      paleo started in high school when my Mom and I thought we would try out
      10-day paleo plan. It was not exactly love at first bite ðŸ˜‰, as our bodies
      had to adjust to this new way of eating, but we decided to continue eating
      paleo after those 10 days and have since become utterly hooked! There is
      no better feeling than fueling your body with real, whole, nutrient-dense
      foods. I feel the best when I eat paleo, but I also am strongly against
      deprivation and very much support a balanced, healthy way of life. So
      while most of the recipes youâ€™ll see here are paleo, I also incorporate
      some non-paleo goods, and those who know me know that I will rarely say no
      to a good old-fashioned (non-paleo) treat. I hope after taking a peak
      around FinleyMintzed you realize how fun and easy it is to make simple,
      delicious, and healthy meals (and desserts) and feel inspired to get
      cooking!

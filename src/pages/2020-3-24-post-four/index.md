### Recipe 

* ½ bag of cauliflower gnocchi (Trader Joe’s is my fave!)
* 1 link pre-chicken sausage (frozen works too)
* 1 zucchini
* 1 bell pepper
* 1 handful of spinach
* 1 T avocado oil
* 1 T olive oil
* 1 t garlic powder
* salt & pepper



### Instructions

1. Heat up 1 T olive oil and add in ½ bag of cauliflower gnocchi (or more if you want more than 1 serving!)
2. Let gnocchi cook without touch for about 5 minutes, then flip and cook the other side for another 5 minutes until all sides are crispy (total time should be about 10-12 minutes)
3. Meanwhile, heat up 1 T avocado oil in a separate pan and add in sliced zucchini and bell pepper, along with garlic powder, salt and pepper
4. Sauté veggies for about 5-7 minutes until softened, then add in frozen chicken sausage and cook until heated through, about another 5-7 minutes; add in spinach at the end to wilt
5. Mix everything together and top with everything but the bagel seasoning.
6. Enjoy!
